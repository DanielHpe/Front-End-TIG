                        <p>Currently the network is present in everything in the world, for example computer network, internet network, network of the food chain, network partners, hotel network and etc. Some big and complex and some simple and small. But then what is a network? Network is a set of entities (people, objects and etc.) interconnected to each other.</p>
                        <p>But then what would be a study of complex networks?
                        The study of complex networks boils down to analyzing the interconnections between graphs and edges when the topographic structure is not trivial. This analysis is used in several fields of research such as sociology, biotechnology, sciences, biomedicine among others. This site aims to provide access to authors and co-authors of articles referring to complex networks.</p>

                        <p>
                            It was verified that there are several studies on complex networks of the most diverse authors and there is not a place to centralize all these studies for this was created the relations of coautoria with that was used the database of Scopus.
                            The co-authoring relationship has the concept of social network, but focused on the collaboration between authors and co-authors. Lately, this relationship has aroused the interest of the students, due to the evolution of the research communities. 
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            It was noted, that much was studied the effect of social networks and knowledge on the scientific impact, but little on the knowledge itself its relation of pairing with the authors, it is understood that the view of bibliographic pairing is appropriate for the knowledge Combined in a specific job.

                            Due to the growth of the researches in complex networks and the search for authors and citations of great authors, the need was found to gather this information in one place. The publisher Elsevier has the largest database of citations and abstracts of literature in the world, called Scopus, from this base was selected the data referring to complex networks to be displayed through a field of research.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The field contains paramaters, where the user can fill in. With those paramaters, the complex network website can access the Scopus database and show to the users, information about complex network based in which paramater was choosed. Beside this, we also provide a series of complex network metrics, with those, the user can obtain a lot of information about the colected data.

                            JQuery is a JavaScript function library that interacts with HTML, designed to simplify interpreted scripts in the client-side browser. Launched in December 2006 at the BarCamp in New York by John Resig. Used by about 77% of the 10,000 most visited sites in the world, jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library.</p>

                         <p>JQuery is an open source library with dual license, making use of the MIT License or the GNU General Public License version 2. The jQuery syntax was developed to make it easier to navigate the HTML document, select DOM elements, create animations , Manipulate events, develop AJAX applications and create plugins on it. Such facilities allow developers to create layers of abstraction for low-level interactions in a simplified way in dynamic web applications of great complexity.

                        JavaScript is an interpreted programming language. It was originally implemented as part of web browsers so that scripts could be run on the client side and interact with the user without the need for this script to go through the server, controlling the browser, performing asynchronous communication and changing the contents of the displayed document.</p>

                        
                        <p>It is currently the main language for client-side programming in web browsers. It also starts being heavily used on the server side through environments such as node.js. It is designed to be a prototype-based object-oriented scripting language, weak and dynamic typing and first-class functions. It supports functional programming and features features such as locks and high order functions commonly unavailable in popular languages ​​such as Java and C ++. It is the most used programming language in the world.

Through Socilab if it is possible to build a graph with your Linkedin friends, the vertices are the Linkedin friends, and the edges are the friendly relations between the users of the Linkedin. </p>

                        	<p>Socilab uses a variety of complex network metrics to analyze its graphs. Each measure of the network was designed through sociological research in professional networks, as well as percentage bars comparing their current measurements with those of past users. The tool also uses Javascript to perform calculations, allowing the user's network to be processed locally on the machine itself.</p>
